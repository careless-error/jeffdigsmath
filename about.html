  <div class="about-text">
  <p>Welcome to my site. Here’s a little about me, if you’re interested.</p>

  <p>After graduating high school in 2007, I gave college a shot while working three jobs. For obvious reasons, it didn’t work out. I dropped out and spent the next stretch bouncing between gigs: sales, customer service, handyman work, security, logistics, warehouse operations—I even spent some time driving around in an old VW van, trying to figure out what was next.</p>

  <p>In 2024, I finally went back to school. I’m now a full-time student studying math and computer science, earning straight As and actually enjoying it. Math came back quicker than I expected, and coding feels like math and writing smashed together in a way that clicks. I’ve taken a Python class, built a few math-related projects, and I’m learning Java now. A great English class even got me into writing. Tutoring reminded me how explaining something to someone else is one of the best ways to learn it yourself.</p>

  <p>When I’m not at school or studying (see: procrastinating), I like to spend time outside and hang with my dogs. Indy is 14 and pretty much blind, but he’s still living his best life. Xena’s got some trauma and a bunch of triggers, but she tries to be a good girl. One of these days, I’ll take six months off and thru-hike the whole PCT. Outside of that, I’m pretty okay at bikes and just about anything mechanical (I used to be a car guy, but bikes are cheaper). I like figuring out how things work—bikes, cars, code, systems, people, my own brain...</p>

  <p>This site is where I collect the things I’m working on: cheat sheets, code projects, tutoring tools, and anything else that feels worth keeping. It’s all a work in progress. So am I.</p>
