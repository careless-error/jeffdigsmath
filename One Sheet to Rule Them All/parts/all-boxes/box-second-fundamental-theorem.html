   <td>
    If \( f \) is continuous on an interval and
                \[ F(x) = \int_a^{g(x)} f(t)\,dt \]
                then
                \[ F'(x) = f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \]
                The derivative of an integral with a variable upper limit is the integrand evaluated at that limit times the derivative of the limit.
